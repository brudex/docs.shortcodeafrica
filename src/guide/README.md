## How It Works

USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) is a protocol used by GSM cellphones to communicate with their service providerâ€™s computers via text messages. We commonly use it to check mobile airtime, transfer money and data balance enquiries, or to receive one-time passwords or PIN codes, among many applications.

USSD most commonly involves a query generated by a cellphone user (such as a balance enquiry). Once this request is sent, the USSD gateway forwards it to your USSD application. The application then responds to the request, and the process is repeated in reverse: the response goes back to the USSD gateway, which displays the content of that response on your phone screen.

Responses are usually sent in an easily displayed format, containing a maximum of 182 alphanumeric characters.
Messages sent over USSD are not defined by any universal standardisation,
so each operator is free to use a format most suited to its customers.
