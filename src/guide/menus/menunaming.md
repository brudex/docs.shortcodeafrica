## Give your Menu a Name
  Every menu created needs to have a special identifier for easy access and reference sort of like variable names in programming. Menu names are special identiers that can be users to access the value of the menu in other menus or actions. Menu names must adhere to same conventions for variable names in programming. 

        - Menu identifiers must not contain spaces
        - Menu identifiers must not begin with numbers 
        - Menu identifiers must not contain special character e.g. (!#$%^&*)
  
## Naming Convention
  It is recommended to name your menus using camel case nomencleture. Long names with clearer understanding should be more favoured than shorter incoherent names. The following are examples of good menu identifiers
  ### E.g. Good Menu Identifiers (Clarity over short names)

  - `mainMenu`, 
  - `accountNumberMenu`, 
  - `phoneNumber`, 
  - `accountNumberForMerchant`, 
  - `loanAmountEnteredByRegisteredUser`, 
  - `transferMoneyMenu`

  On the "Menu" tab we can give menu a name or identifier .
  The field in the image below is an example of a menu name and the name should not have space in it (eg. Transfer Money should be TransferMoney).
